      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Machiel Reyneke. I live in the Cape Winelands, South Africa with my wife Michela and our
        two daughters.
      </p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I lead product at 10X Investments, where we're trying to make investing less confusing and
        less expensive for South Africans. I spend most of my time figuring out what to build, why,
        and whether we're actually solving real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before product management, I was a fire engineer — yes, that's a real job. I investigated
        fires, modeled smoke spread in buildings, and learned to think in systems. Then I spent
        nearly a decade in tech startups, shipping apps and leading teams.
      </p>

      <h2>What I'm interested in</h2>
      <p>
        I like to tinker. Most of my projects start as "I wonder if I could..." and end up as tools
        I actually use. I'm drawn to Nassim Taleb's work on risk and uncertainty, Adlerian
        psychology, and Stoicism — philosophies that put responsibility where it belongs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm fascinated by AI and what it means for how we work. I built Slate, a todo app, almost
        entirely through AI-assisted development. It took three weeks. That would have been months
        before. I'm still processing what that implies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I run. I've learned more about training from understanding fat oxidation than from any "run
        more miles" advice.
      </p>

      <h2>What this site is</h2>
      <p>
        A record of things I've done and thought about. I write for myself first — to clarify my
        thinking and have something to look back on. If you find something useful here, that's a
        bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not trying to build an audience or sell anything. I'm just putting my work somewhere it
        can be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing here represents 10X or anyone else. If I write about finances, it's personal
        opinion, not advice — I'm not a financial advisor.
