      <h1>Hey there</h1>
      <p>I'm Machiel — product manager, tinkerer, occasional writer. Based in South Africa.</p>
      <p>
        I work at <a href="https://www.10x.co.za">10X Investments</a>, making smart investing
        accessible to regular people. Before that: fire engineering, tech startups, and a lot of
        learning the hard way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is where I put things I've built, things I've learned, and things I'm thinking
        about.
      </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Things I've built for myself. Not startups, not products — just tools that solve my own
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Slate</strong> — A todo app for ADHD brains and their AI assistants. Graph-based task
        relationships, daily resets, no guilt. Built with Claude Code in three weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Runistry</strong> — Advanced analytics for Garmin runners. Because the default dashboards
        aren't enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Commander's Intent</strong> — AI-powered daily briefing system. Aggregates emails and
        calendar, synthesizes into actionable morning insights using Claude.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Eskom Dashboards</strong> — Visualizing South African load shedding and power generation
        data. Because checking schedules wasn't painful enough in 2023.
      </p>
